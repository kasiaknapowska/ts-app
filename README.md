# React app with typescript

This project is a solution for recruitment task.

## Task description

The goal of this task was to create an application, which displays data fetched from [API endpoint](https://swapi.dev/). The UI was provided [here](https://www.figma.com/file/woqB48WOrmMytlS6MlkSWA/Untitled?nodeid=
0%3A1&t=5JYNYeuz7u1WfY5q-1). 

Random pictures should have been fetched from [picsum endpoint](https://.picsum.photos/534/383). 

A form should have been implemented with a basic error handling.

## How it works

When "next profile" button is clicked the application fetches next sort of data.
Form data and all the people displayed when "next profile" are clicked are posted to fake database (https://example/).
